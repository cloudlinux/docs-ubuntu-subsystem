## MySQL Governor

MySQL Governor is software to monitor and restrict MySQL usage in a shared hosting environment. The monitoring is done via resource usage statistics per each MySQL thread.

MySQL Governor has two active modes of operations:
* **off** - In this mode MySQL Governor will not throttle customer's queries, instead it will let you monitor the MySQL usage.
* **abusers** - In this mode, once user goes over the limits specified in the MySQL Governor, all customer's queries will execute inside that user's LVE.

More details of the governor operation modes are described in the [Modes of operation section](https://docs.cloudlinux.com/cloudlinux_os_components/#modes-of-operation)

MySQL Governor allows restricting customers who use too many resources. It supports following limits:

| | | |
|-|-|-|
|CPU|%|CPU speed relative to one core. 150% would mean one and a half cores|
|READ|bytes|bytes read. Cached reads are not counted, only those that were actually read from disk will be counted|
|WRITE|bytes|bytes written. Cached writes are not counted, only once data is written to disk, it is counted|

You can set different limits for different periods: current, short, med, long. By default those periods are defined as 1 second, 5 seconds, 1 minute and 5 minutes. They can be re-defined using the [configuration file](https://docs.cloudlinux.com/cloudlinux_os_components/#configuration-and-operation). The idea is to use larger acceptable values for shorter periods. Like you could allow a customer to use two cores (200%) for one second, but only 1 core (on average) for 1 minute, and only 70% within 5 minutes. That would make sure that customer can burst for short periods of time.

Customers will also be limited to a finite number of concurrent connections, this number is 30 by default and can be changed. This is done so they wouldn't use up all the MySQL connections to the server. MySQL Governor can also kill off slow SELECT queries.

### Installation 

:::warning Attention!
MySQL Governor on Ubuntu supports the following only:
* cl-MySQL80 on non-panel system
* cl-MySQL80 on cPanel 
* cl-MariaDB103 on  non-panel system
:::
 
1. Install MySQL Governor
```
apt  install governor-mysql
```
2. To use MySQL Governor with

    * cl-MariaDB103 
    ```
    /usr/share/lve/dbgovernor/mysqlgovernor.py --mysql-version=mariadb103
    ```
    * cl-MySQL80 
    ```
    /usr/share/lve/dbgovernor/mysqlgovernor.py --mysql-version=mysql80
    ```
3. Backup your databases.
4. Run the cl-MySQL/cl-MariaDB installation.
```
/usr/share/lve/dbgovernor/mysqlgovernor.py --install --yes
```
In case of installing on cPanel + Ubuntu server, set the following parameter:

![](/images/Param.png)
5. After installation, check that the database server is working properly. If you have any problems, use [Support Portal]().
6. Configure user mapping to the database. The mapping format is described in the [following section](https://docs.cloudlinux.com/cloudlinux_os_components/#mapping-a-user-to-a-database).

In case a non-panel system the `/etc/container/dbuser-map` should be created and updated with new users by admin.

The format is as follows:

```
[dbuser_name1] [account_name1] [UID1]
...
[dbuser_nameN] [account_nameN] [UIDN]
```

The control panel should automatically generate such mapping and write it to the `/etc/container/dbuser-map`. Usually, it is enough to write a hook when adding, deleting or renaming a database for a user. The control panel should implement such a mechanism for MySQL Governor to operate properly. MySQL Governor automatically applies changes from the dbuser-map file every five minutes.

7. MySQL Governor configuration can be found in the following [section](https://docs.cloudlinux.com/cloudlinux_os_components/#configuration-3).
8. MySQL Governor CLI tools description can be found in the following [section](https://docs.cloudlinux.com/command-line_tools/#mysql-governor).
9. Having configured the mapping use `dbtop` to see the current user load on the database (you'd need to make some database queries).
```
dbtop
```
10. If the load appears in the dbtop output, then you have successfully configured MySQL Governor.

### How To upgrade database server

You can find the instructions in [this documentation](https://docs.cloudlinux.com/cloudlinux_os_components/#upgrading-database-server).

### Uninstalling

To remove MySQL Governor, run the following command:
```
$ /usr/share/lve/dbgovernor/mysqlgovernor.py --delete
```

The script will install the original MySQL server, and remove MySQL Governor.

### Configuration and operation

## Mod_hostinglimits

LVE is a kernel level technology developed by the CloudLinux team. The technology has common roots with container based virtualization and uses cgroups in its latest incarnation. It is lightweight and transparent. The goal of LVE is to make sure that no single web site can bring down your web server.

Today, a single site can consume all CPU, IO, Memory resources or Apache processes - and bring the server to a halt. LVE prevents that. It is done via collaboration of Apache module, PAM module and kernel.

[mod_hostinglimits](https://docs.cloudlinux.com/cloudlinux_os_components/#hostinglimits-module-for-apache) is an Apache module that:
* detects VirtualHost from which the request came;
* detects if it was meant for CGI or PHP script;
* puts Apache process used to serve that request into LVE for the user determined via SuexecUserGroup directive for that virtual host;
* lets Apache to serve the request;
* removes Apache process from user's LVE.

The kernel makes sure that all LVEs get fair share of the server's resources, and that no customer can use more then the limits set for that customer. Today we can limit CPU , Memory (virtual and physical), IO, number of processes as well as the number of entry processes (concurrent connections to apache).

Each LVE limits amount of entry processes (Apache processes entering into LVE) to prevent single site exhausting all Apache processes. If the limit is reached, then mod_hostinglimits will not be able to place Apache process into LVE, and will return error code 508. This way very heavy site would slow down and start returning 508 errors, without affecting other users.

* If the site is limited by CPU or IO, then the site will start responding slower.
* If the site is limited by memory or number of processes limits, then the user will receive 500 or 503 errors that server cannot execute the script.

## Apache mod_lsapi

### General requirements

General requirements are available [here](https://docs.cloudlinux.com/cloudlinux_os_components/#general-information-and-requirements-9).

### Installation 

Installation on cPanel servers with EasyApache 4:

```
$ apt install liblsapi liblsapi-dev 
$ apt install ea-apache24-mod-lsapi
$ /usr/bin/switch_mod_lsapi --setup
$ service httpd restart
```

Installation on servers with no panel:

```
$ apt install liblsapi liblsapi-dev 
$ apt install mod-lsapi
$ /usr/bin/switch_mod_lsapi --setup
$ service apache2 restart
```

### Configuration

Configuration instructions are available [here](https://docs.cloudlinux.com/cloudlinux_os_components/#configuration-4).

### Troubleshooting

In case the site responds with the error: 503 Service unavailable.

1. Be sure that /opt has drwxr-xr-x permissions. It can be fixed with the following command:

```
$ chmod 755 /opt 
```

2. Change the default folder for mod_lsapi socket:

```
$ mkdir /var/mod_lsapi
$ chown nobody.nobody /var/mod_lsapi
$ chmod 755 /var/mod_lsapi
```

Add to /etc/apache2/conf.d/lsapi.conf new path:

```
lsapi_socket_path /var/mod_lsapi
```

And restart service:

```
$ service httpd restart
```

### Uninstall

Uninstall procedure for cPanel servers with EasyApache 4:

```
$ /usr/bin/switch_mod_lsapi --uninstall
$ apt remove liblsapi liblsapi-dev ea-apache24-mod-lsapi
```

Uninstall procedure for servers with no panel:

```
$ /usr/bin/switch_mod_lsapi --uninstall
$ apt remove liblsapi liblsapi-dev mod-lsapi
```
